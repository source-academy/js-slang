\section*{Arrays}

Arrays in Source are created using literal array expressions:
\begin{lstlisting}
let my_array_1 = [];
let my_array_2 = [42, 71, 13];
\end{lstlisting}
Arrays in Source are limited to integers as keys.
In statements like
\begin{lstlisting}
a[i];
a[j] = v;
\end{lstlisting}
the values \lstinline{i} and \lstinline{j} must be integers if \lstinline{a} is an array.

Note that pairs in Source are represented by arrays with two elements. Therefore,
\begin{lstlisting}
is_pair([1, 2]);
\end{lstlisting}
and
\begin{lstlisting}
equal(pair(1, 2), [1, 2]);
\end{lstlisting}
evaluate to \texttt{true}.

Access of an array with an integer index to which no prior assignment has been
made on the array, returns \texttt{undefined}.

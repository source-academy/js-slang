Source §3 Concurrent is a small programming language, designed for the third chapter
of the textbook
<a href="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg">Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation</a> (SICP JS).

## What can you do in Source §3 Concurrent?

You can use all features of
<a href="../source_3/">Source §3</a> and all
features that are introduced in
<a href="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/chapters/65">chapter 3.4</a> of the
textbook.
Below are the features that Source §3 Concurrent adds to Source §3.

### Concurrency

To introduce concurrency into your programs, you can use the
functions in the <a href="../CONCURRENCY/">CONCURRENCY</a> group
of predeclared functions, already mentioned above. All programs
run in Source §3 Concurrent are concurrent programs, and they return
`undefined`. To get feedback from your programs, use the `display` predeclared
function.

## You want the definitive specs?

For our development team, we are maintaining a definitive description
of the language, called the

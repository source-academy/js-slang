Source §3 Concurrent is a small programming language, designed for the third chapter
of the textbook
<a href="https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs">Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation</a> (SICP JS).

## What can you do in Source §3 Concurrent?

You can use all features of
<a href="../source_3/">Source §3</a> and all
features that are introduced in
<a href="https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/3.4">chapter 3.4</a> of the
textbook.
Below are the features that Source §3 Concurrent adds to Source §3.

### Concurrency

To introduce concurrency into your programs, you can use the
functions in the <a href="../CONCURRENCY/">CONCURRENCY</a> library. The program
runs concurrently with the threads that it creates. The program terminates when
all threads terminate. Any result value from any of the threads, including the
program's thread, are ignored. Use the predeclared `display` function to display
result values.

## You want the definitive specs?

of the language, called the

## What can you do in Source §2?

You can use all features of
<a href="../source_1/">Source §1</a> and all
features that are introduced in
<a href="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/chapters/23">chapter 2</a> of the
textbook.
Below are the features that Source §2 adds to Source §1.

### The empty list `null`

Source §2 provides a new primitive value, `null`, that serves as empty list.

### The LIST functions

To work with lists, you can use the functions in the
<a href="../LISTS/">LISTS</a> group of predeclared functions, already mentioned
above.

## You want the definitive specs?

For our development team, we are maintaining a definitive description
of the language, called the
<a href="../source_2.pdf">Specification of Source §2</a>. Feel free to

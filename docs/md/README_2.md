Source §2 is a small programming language, designed for the second chapter
of the textbook
<a href="https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs">Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation</a> (SICP JS).

## What names are predeclared in Source §2?

On the right, you see all predeclared names of Source §2, in alphabetical
order. Click on a name to see how it is defined and used. They come in
these groups:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="../MISC/">MISC</a>: Miscellaneous constants and functions
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="../MATH/">MATH</a>: Mathematical constants and functions
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="../LISTS/">LISTS</a>: Support for lists
    </li>
  </ul>

## What can you do in Source §2?

You can use all features of
<a href="../source_1/">Source §1</a> and all
features that are introduced in
<a href="https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/2">chapter 2</a> of the
textbook.
Below are the features that Source §2 adds to Source §1.

### The empty list `null`

Source §2 provides a new primitive value, `null`, that serves as empty list.

### The LIST functions

To work with lists, you can use the functions in the
<a href="../LISTS/">LISTS</a> group of predeclared functions, already mentioned
above.

## You want the definitive specs?

For our development team, we are maintaining a definitive description
of the language, called the
<a href="../source_2.pdf">Specification of Source §2</a>. Feel free to
take a peek!

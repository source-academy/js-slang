\subsection*{Continuation Support}
\label{conc_supp}
The following functions are supported for generating and consuming continuations:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{call\_cc(f)}: \(\textit{primitive}\), generates a coninuation \texttt{cont} and calls \texttt{f(cont)}. This is an atomic operation.
\end{itemize}

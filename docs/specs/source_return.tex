\subsection*{Restrictions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Return statements are only allowed in bodies of functions.
\item There cannot be any newline character between
  $\textbf{\texttt{return}}$ and $\textit{expression}$ in return statements.\footnote{
  Source inherits this syntactic quirk of JavaScript.}
\item There cannot be any newline character between
  $(\ \textit{name}\ | \ \textbf{\texttt{(}}\ \textit{parameters}\ \textbf{\texttt{)}}\ )$
  and
  $\texttt{\textbf{=>}}$ in function definition expressions.\footnote{ditto}
\item Implementations of Source are allowed to treat function
  declaration as \href{https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/1.3.2\#footnote-2}{
    syntactic sugar for constant declaration}.\footnote{ECMAScript prescribes ``hoisting''
    of function declarations to the beginning of the surrounding block. Programs that rely
    on this feature will run fine in JavaScript but might encounter a runtime error ``Cannot
    access name before initialization'' in a Source implementation.}
  Source programmers need
  to make sure that functions are not called before their corresponding function declaration
  is evaluated.

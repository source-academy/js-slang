\subsection*{Restrictions}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Single assignment language: Each variable
  can be assigned a value only once during its
  lifetime.
  
\item
  Operators do not implicitly cast boolean 
  values to integers. Booleans cannot be used 
  interchangeably with integers in operations.

\item
  Scope restriction: Each variable
  can only be accessed in the block it is
  declared.
\end{itemize}

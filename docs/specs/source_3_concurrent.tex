Source \S 3 Concurrent is a concurrent extension of Source \S 3.

\section*{Changes}

Source \S 3 Concurrent modifies Source \S 3 in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item Concurrency support functions are added, see Section~\textbf{Concurrency Support} on page \pageref{conc_supp}.
\item The given program starts in a thread that runs concurrently with any
  threads that are created during the execution of the program.
\item Neither the thread of the give program nor any other threads produce
  any values as results. Their effect is observable through \emph{side effects}
  such as calls of the \lstinline{display} primitive.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
The concurrency of Source \S 3 Concurrent is thread-based and deviates
from the event-driven concurrency of  
\href{http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf}{\color{DarkBlue}
  ECMAScript 2018 ($9^{\textrm{th}}$ Edition)}. Source \S 3 Concurrent is
motivated by Section 3.4 of the textbook
\href{https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg}{\color{DarkBlue}\emph{Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs}, JavaScript Adaptation}.

\section*{Concurrency}

We specify \emph{interleaving semantics} for Source \S 3 Concurrent.
The effect of executing a Source \S 3 Concurrent program
should be explainable as a single sequence of atomic actions. Each thread
specifies a particular sequence of actions in a specific order,
and the implementation is free to interleave the sequences of the threads
into a single sequence, as long as the following conditions are met:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The order of actions within each thread is respected (sequential
  threads).
\item Any action that is included in any thread's sequence of actions will
  eventually be executed (no starvation).
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
The atomic actions are primitive steps such as accessing the value of a name,
accessing a data structure, reducing a conditional expression or statement,
carrying out a primitive operation or calling a function. Such atomic actions
are considered \emph{uninterruptible}; they specify the \emph{granularity}
of the concurrency.

\subsection*{Import directives}

Import directives allow programs to import values from modules and bind them to names, whose scope
is the entire program in which the import directive occurs.  Import directives can only appear at the top-level.  All names that appear in import directives
must be distinct, and must also be distinct from all top-level variables.  The Source specifications do not specify how modules are
programmed.

## What can you do in Source §3.4?

You can use all features of
<a href="../source_3/">Source §3</a> and all
features that are introduced in
<a href="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/chapters/65">chapter 3.4</a> of the
textbook.
Below are the features that Source §3.4 adds to Source §3.

### Concurrency
To introduce concurrency into your programs, you can use the
functions in the <a href="../CONCURRENCY/">CONCURRENCY</a> group
of predeclared functions, already mentioned above. All programs
run in Source §3.4 are concurrent programs, and they return
`undefined`.

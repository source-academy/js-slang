Source §2 is a small programming language, designed for the second chapter
of the textbook
<a href="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg">Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation</a> (SICP JS). 

## What names are predeclared in Source §2?

On the right, you see all predeclared names of Source §2, in alphabetical

    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="../BINARYTREES/index.html">BINARYTREES</a>: Library for binary trees
    </li>
  </ul>

## What can you do in Source §2?

You can use all features of
<a href="../source_1/">Source §1</a> and all
features that are introduced in
<a href="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/chapters/23">chapter 2</a> of the
textbook.
Below are the features that Source §2 adds to Source §1.

### The empty list `null`

Source §2 provides a new primitive value, `null`, that serves as empty list.

### The LIST functions

To work with lists, you can use the functions in the
<a href="../LISTS/">LISTS</a> group of predeclared functions, already mentioned
above.

## You want the definitive specs?

For our development team, we are maintaining a definitive description
of the language, called the
<a href="../source_2.pdf">Specification of Source §2</a>. Feel free to

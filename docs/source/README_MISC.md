On the right, you see all predeclared names of MISC, in alphabetical
order. Click on a name to see how it is defined and used.

Once you have read <a href="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/chapters/14">section 1.2.3 Orders
of Growth</a> of the textbook, you may wonder about the order of growth of these functions.
You can assume that all functions in MISC run
in `O(1)` time, except `display`, `error` and `stringify`, 
which run in `O(n)` time, where `n` is
the size (number of components such as pairs)
of their first argument. More on pairs in 
<a href="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/chapters/23">chapter 2 Building Abstractions with Data</a>
of the textbook.

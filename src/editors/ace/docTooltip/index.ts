// (18 March 2022)
// Problem to be fixed in the future:
//
// There seems to be an inconsistency between how jest and how typescript
// behaves when encountering imports of the form `import * as x from 'x.json'`
// jest will set x = jsonobject,
// but typescript will instead set x = { default: jsonobject }
//
// This means that under typescript, we want `import x from 'x.json'`,
// while under jest, we want `import * as x from 'x.json'`
//
// This problem was hidden when transpiling to CommonJS modules before, which
// behaves similarly to jest. But now that we are transpiling to es6,
// typescript projects that depend on js-slang may now be exposed to this
// inconsistency.
//
// For now, we use brute force until the landscape changes or someone thinks of
// a proper solution.

  // `json` doesn't inherit from `Object`?
  // Can't use hasOwnProperty for some reason.
  if ('default' in json) {
    return json.default

    return json

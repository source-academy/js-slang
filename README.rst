Error messages
--------------

To enable verbose messages, have the statement ``"enable verbose";`` as the first line of your code.

There are two main kinds of error messages: those that occur at runtime and those that occur at parse time. 
The first can be found in interpreter-errors.ts, while the second can be found in rules/.

Each error subclass will have explain() and elaborate(). Displaying the error will always cause the first to be
called; the second is only called when verbose mode is enabled. As such, explain() should be made to return a string
containing the most basic information about what the error entails. Any additional details about the error message,
including specifics and correction guides, should be left to elaborate().

Please remember to write test cases to reflect your added functionalities. The god of this repository is self-professed
to be very particular about test cases.

\subsection*{Array Support}

The following array processing function is supported:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline{array_length(x)}: \textit{builtin}, returns
  the current length of array \lstinline{x}, which is 1 plus the
highest index \lstinline{i} that has been used so far in an array assignment on \lstinline{x}.
\end{itemize}
